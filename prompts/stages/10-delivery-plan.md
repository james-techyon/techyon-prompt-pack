- RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)
- Release plan: environments, branching, QA gates, rollback, comms, changelog
```

Execution feasibility:
- Green if plan fits within all constraints
- Yellow if minor adjustments needed
- Red if major gaps in resources/timeline
Recommend descoping or resource additions.
```
