## Purpose
Design monetization strategy, unit economics, and pricing structure that aligns with value delivery.

## Required Inputs

- {FounderGoals}
- {KeyMetricsNorthStar}

## Assets Produced

- Pricing & Packaging Structure
- Pricing Page Copy

## Prompt

```
Deliver:
- Revenue model options (usage, seat, tiered, hybrid) with when-to-use guidance
- Unit economics: LTV, CAC hypothesis, payback period; sensitivity table
- Packaging: Good/Better/Best (value metrics, feature gating)
- Pricing page copy (hero, value bullets, plan grid, FAQs, guarantee)

Include 3 pricing experiments with success metrics and stop/scale rules.
```

---

## Gate Check Prompt

```
Validate pricing viability:
- Green if LTV:CAC > 3:1 and payback < 12 months
- Yellow if metrics are marginal but improvable
- Red if unit economics don't work at any reasonable scale
Recommend pricing pivots if yellow/red.
```

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] LTV:CAC ratio > 3:1
- [ ] Gross margin > 70% (SaaS) or category-appropriate
- [ ] Payback period < 12 months
- [ ] Clear value metric identified
- [ ] Pricing aligns with competitor analysis

## Common Pitfalls
- Pricing based on cost, not value
- Too many pricing tiers
- Unclear value differentiation
- Ignoring price sensitivity research
