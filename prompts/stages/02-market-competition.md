# Stage 2: Market & Competition Analysis

## Purpose
Size the opportunity, understand competitive dynamics, and identify defensible positioning.

## Required Inputs
- Validated problem from Stage 1
- {Industry/Regulatory}
- {Geography}

## Assets Produced
- TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis
- Market Segmentation
- Competitive Landscape
- Moat Hypotheses

---

## Prompt

```
Deliver:
1) TAM/SAM/SOM (method + quick math).
2) Segmentation: 3â€“5 slices with attractiveness scores (size, urgency, CAC proxy, ease-of-access).
3) Competitor matrix (rows competitors; cols: target segment, price, UX quality, distribution, moats).
4) Moat hypotheses (data network effects, switching costs, unique data, workflow lock-in, brand/regs), with test plans.

Output as: 
- 1-paragraph summary
- 1 table for TAM/SAM/SOM
- 1 competitor matrix
- 5 moat hypotheses + how to test each (evidence to collect)
```

## Gate Check Prompt

```
Recommend segment focus if: highest attractiveness score AND at least one plausible moat hypothesis. Else, propose new wedge.
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] TAM > $1B (or aligned with founder goals)
- [ ] SAM represents achievable 3-year target
- [ ] Clear competitive gaps identified
- [ ] At least 1 defensible moat hypothesis
- [ ] Segment with >7/10 attractiveness score

## Common Pitfalls
- Overestimating TAM with weak assumptions
- Ignoring indirect competitors
- Choosing segment based on size alone
- Weak moat hypotheses
